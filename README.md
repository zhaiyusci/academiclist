A domain list of academic press

Here is a list of the domains the academic press uses.

Nowadays universities and some institute buy the papers from the publishers.  The real users, e.g. students and professors, can visit them inside the colleges and use the IP address the institutes provide.  It means if you use another way to connect to the Internet, you will NOT able to read papers unless you change the way manually.  

And how to do it automatically?  I do not want to provide more details here but everything is based on a list containing the publishers.

Personally I work on Physical Chemistry and this list contains some domains in my field.  You are welcome to add more to the list.

This list will not divided by subject because some of the press just publish in all fields.
